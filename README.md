# Bootcamp-Challenge-1-Sal
Horiseon webpage with add tags for accessibility.

<Horiseon Challenge 1>

## Description

- Clients asked us to make the webpage more accessible. I started the project to be able to improve my skills in html and css. I optimized the html file by using better semantic tags for the elements. I reduced the number of classes with a more efficent design for both html and css files. I learnt about many different types of element and attribute tags in html and css.
