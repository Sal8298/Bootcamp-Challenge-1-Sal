# Bootcamp-Challenge-1-Sal
Horiseon webpage with add tags for accessibility.

<Horiseon Challenge 1>

## Description

- Clients asked us to make the webpage more accessible. I started the project to be able to improve my skills in html and css. I optimized the html file by using better semantic tags for the elements. I reduced the number of classes with a more efficent design for both html and css files. I learnt about many different types of element and attribute tags in html and css.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
